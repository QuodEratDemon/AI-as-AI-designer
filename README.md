AI as AI designer: Fine-Tuning Utility Values Using Genetic Algorithms



Self designing, Utility based AI using an open-source Bomberman clone by Drummyfish.


Make sure there is no PLAYER, and only AI, or the simulation will crash.



Overview:

We used a genetic algorithms to fine-tune how the values of a Utility-based AI are generated so that the optimal behavior eventually emerges.



Novelty: 

Using the genetic algorithm, we are letting the AI design itself and perfecting the utility curves for us. This has never been done before.


Value:
As it stands right now, designers have to spend hours painstakingly adjusting the curves of utility algorithms manually if they want to customize the behavior of the NPC they are designing. Our approach would allow them to specify a desired behavior and our AI would then proceed to adjust the utility curves as needed to produce that behavior.
